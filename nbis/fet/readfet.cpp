      Contains routines responsible for reading the contents of
      a file into a data structure holding an attribute-value
      paired list.

      ROUTINES:
#cat: readfetfile - opens an fet file and reads its contents into an
#cat:               fet structure.  Exits on error.
#cat: readfetfile_ret - opens an fet file and reads its contents into an
#cat:               fet structure.  Returns on error.
